//Complete the instructions for each numbered problem. Each numbered problem is worth 10 points

//1. data types built-in methods, variables

//a. define a variable and give it a string value
    const favMovie = "Rush Hour";
//b. define a variable and give it a number value
    const age = 28;
//c. define a variable and give it a boolean value

//a. define a variable 'metrocard' and give it a value of 5
    const metrocard = 5;
//b. write an if statement that has a condition to check if the value of metro card is greater than 2.75, and display the message "you have enough to ride the train", if the condition is true
   let value = true; if (value > 2.75) {console.log("you have enough to ride the train");}
//c.write an else statement that displays the message "you do not have enough to pay fare sorry"
<<<<<<< HEAD
    else{console.log("you do not have enough to pay fare sorry")};
//d. write the above if/else statement again as a ternary 
    value? console.log("you have enough to ride the train") : console.log("you do not have enough to pay fare sorry");

//3. arrays
//a. define a variable myArray and assign it to a value of an array. Give the array at least 5 elements
    const myArray = ['pizza','hamburger','sushi','salad','pasta'];
//b. an array's index starts at:
//Array index starts at 0.

//4. loops 
//a. write a for loop that console logs even numbers starting at 10 and decrementing to 0 
    for(let counter= 10; counter >= 0; counter --)
    {console.log(counter);}
//5. objects
//a. define a variable named 'bike' 
    const bike = {};
//b. assign an object to bike 
    const bike ={height}; 
//c. give the object 3 properties: handlebars, color, wheels 
    const bike ={height, handlebars, color , wheels};
//d. give each property a value 
    const bike ={height: '47 inches', handlebars: 'flat bars', color :'greeen', wheels: 'strong'};

//6. Chessboard
/*Write a function that creates a string that represents an 8Ã—8 grid, using newline characters to separate lines. At each position of the grid there is either a space or a "#" character. The characters should form a chessboard.

Passing this string to console.log should show something like this:

 # # # #
# # # # 
 # # # #
# # # # 
 # # # #
# # # # 
 # # # #
# # # #
When you have a program that generates this pattern, define a binding size = 8. 
**You do not need to accept user input this differs from Eloquent JS's directions 

read and refer to https://eloquentjavascript.net/02_program_structure.html  there are hints at the bottom of the page
